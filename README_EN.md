## Project Overview

This is a browser-based bookmark navigation webpage designed to transform bookmark data (stored in JSON format) into an aesthetically pleasing and feature-rich web application. Through this webpage, you can conveniently access your bookmarks. It supports features such as expanding and collapsing multi-level folders, searching, and breadcrumb navigation.

Users  can access the following links to experience it:

[EdgeOne](https://chuwubookmarks.edgeone.app/)

[CloudFlare](https://chuwubookmarks.pages.dev/)

[Vercel](https://chuwubookmarks.vercel.app/)

[Netlify](https://chuwubookmarks.netlify.app/)

[Surge](http://chuwubookmarks.surge.sh/) (The version may be ahead or behind)

## Export of the JSON-formatted Bookmark Tree

The JSON-formatted bookmark tree is exported by the browser extension [BookmarksPortal](https://github.com/HatsuChuwu/BookmarksPortal) developed by me.
